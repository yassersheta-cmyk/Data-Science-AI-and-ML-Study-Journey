  My study notes and projects for Data Science and AI
# [cs50 Intro to Computer Science](CS50(Into_To_Computer_Science)_compressed.pdf)
Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science provided a rigorous foundation in the art of programming and problem-solving. It bridged the gap between low-level concepts like memory management in C and high-level abstraction using Python and SQL. Beyond syntax, this course cultivated a deep understanding of algorithmic thinking and efficient software design.

# [SQL_Basics](Basics_SQL_Microsoft_SQL_Server.pdf)
   "Proficient in using Microsoft SQL Server for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis. I am skilled in writing complex queries involving multiple joins, subqueries, and window functions to derive actionable insights. My experience extends to handling large datasets efficiently, ensuring data accuracy and readiness for analytical or reporting purposes."

# [Git and Github]( Git_and_Github_(basics).pdf)   

  Proficient in using Git for version control to manage code evolution and ensure project integrity. I am experienced in the full GitHub workflow, from creating branches and managing pull requests to resolving merge conflicts effectively. This allows me to collaborate seamlessly within software teams and maintain a clean, organized codebase.

# [pandas and data cleaning](Pandas_and_Data_Cleaning_compressed.pdf)  

  Proficient in using the Pandas library for comprehensive data manipulation and analysis in Python. I specialize in the critical data cleaning phase: handling missing values, correcting data types, and filtering noise to ensure dataset quality. This rigorous preparation is foundational for building accurate and reliable Machine Learning models.

# [numpy](Numpy(Basics)_compressed.pdf)

 Leveraging NumPy for high-performance numerical computing and matrix operations. I utilize N-dimensional arrays and vectorized processing to handle large datasets efficiently, significantly optimizing calculation speed compared to standard lists. This expertise is critical for implementing the linear algebra logic required in Machine Learning algorithms.
